TEDxUofA is a university-wide initiative to engage with the community for an event filled with inspiration, discovery, and excitement. We're an independent TEDx event that is operated under license from [TED](https://ted.com).

Borrowing the template from the world-renowned TED conference, TEDxUofA aims to bring a TED-like experience to the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu).

Our vision is to showcase the most fascinating thinkers, dreamers and doers that come from the Zona family for an event of presentations, discussions, entertainment, and art that will spark new ideas and opportunities across all who attend.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. Ours is specifically organized and presented entirely by members affiliated with the University of Arizona.

Don't forget to Bear Down!
